# Milestone-Project-1_Browser-Game

This is a Sudoku Puzzle. My first project of the NCSU/Hacker-U Bootcamp

It includes an error counter that tracks the number of incorrect attempts, a timer that indicates the current time, a sudoku grid that contains prefilled numbers and selectable numbers at the bottom. In order to place the proposed number into the grid, first select the number from the row at the bottom and then select the cell that you would like to place it in. If the number is incorrectly placed (there are more than one of the same number in each row, column or 9 cell grid) it will not be shown on the grid and the number of incorrect attempts will increase.
